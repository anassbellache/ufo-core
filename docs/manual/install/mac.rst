Installation on MacOS X
=======================

Preface: This information is kindly provided by Andrey Shkarin and Roman
Shkarin.

.. highlight:: bash

1. Install the MacPorts from http://macports.org

   .. note:: 
   
       If you previously installed MacPorts, and it can not be started after
       latest installation. `Error: port dlopen (...`
       You must download the tar.gz file and install it using a terminal::

           ./configure
           make
           sudo make install

2. Install the necessary packages through macports::

       sudo port install glib2
       sudo port install gtk2
       sudo port install json-glib

3. Install CMake from http://cmake.org

4. Make ufo-core

   1. Got to the directory ufo-core and run::

       export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
       cmake .

   2. Run::

       make
       sudo make install

   3. Installation is complete, perhaps the last lines are as follows::

       -- Installing: /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/ufo.pc
       CMake Error at src/bindings/cmake_install.cmake:33 (FILE):
       file INSTALL cannot find
         "/Users/Andrey/Desktop/ufo-distr/ufo-core/src/bindings/../src/Ufo-0.1.gir".
       Call Stack (most recent call first):
         src/cmake_install.cmake:60 (INCLUDE)
         cmake_install.cmake:32 (INCLUDE)
       make: *** [install] Error 1

5. Make filters

   1. Go to ufo-filters directory. Now, since libufo was installed in lib64, we must update the paths to look
   for shared libraries::

       export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:/usr/local/lib64
       export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig

   2. Run::

       cmake .
       make
       sudo make install

6. Build the test project and verify that everything works.
